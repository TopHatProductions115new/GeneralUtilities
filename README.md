# GeneralUtilities
A bundle of general utilities, for use in any future projects


Added boolean and some (subjectively) convenient macros thus far, aiming for:
 - string (managed unsigned char array)
 - tree
 - graph


Will be using this as a reference, once I reach he last two items:

Tested (minimally) with:

Note: Using tabs, indent size 2.
